# Notes

* When installing with create-react-app make sure to use matching version below. Otherwise, the setup seems to work, but Typescript is not installed.

```
Expected version "^10.13.0 || ^12.13.0 || ^14.15.0 || >=15.0.0". Got "12.7.0"
```

Use Grommet for a minimum style from the beginning. https://v2.grommet.io/
Followed the setup only for the theme, font and body reset.

DO NOT USE ANY CSS
